# ESP32-BLE-Touchpad-ELAN

 An ESP32-based Bluetooth touchpad project that drives an ELAN or any generic controller touchpad (PS/2 variant) to connect to a computer or mobile phone via Bluetooth, providing mouse functionality.

## Motivation

It all started with discomfort—I couldn’t lean back comfortably in my chair without having to keep my hand on the table just to move the mouse. So I searched to see if there were any USB touchpads, but the prices were outrageous. Then I looked for Bluetooth touchpads, but only found ones bundled with mini keyboards.

Eventually, I started looking for ways to build one myself and found many tutorials on converting old touchpads into external mice. BUT THEY WERE ALL SYNAPTICS. Meanwhile, the only touchpad I had was an ELAN, and fortunately, its pinout was easier to identify thanks to its simple labeling:
- TV: VCC
- TG: Ground
- TD: Data
- TC: Clock

With zero Arduino knowledge (of course idk how to use ESP32), I boldly experimented with many things until I finally got it working. Special thanks to Kristopher for the PS2-Mouse-Arduino library, T-vK for the ESP32-BLE-Mouse library, and Gaowanliang for the Synaptics-based references—which I didn’t understand at all. Without them, I would never have been able to create this masterpiece.


## Feature List

- [x] Mouse movement
- [x] Tap to click
- [x] Single-finger double tap as mouse left click (build-in from my touchpad)
- [x] Tap and drag to enable dragging
- [x] Physical left and right mouse button (build-in from my touchpad)
- [x] Vertical and horizontal scroll switch using button1
- [x] Left CTRL using button2

I still don't know how to active multitouch, it just won't give any data if more than 1 finger touch it.

## Compilation

This program is compiled using PlatformIO. You can compile it by installing the PlatformIO plugin in VSCode. The project has already configured the `platformio.ini` file. You just need to open the project folder and click the PlatformIO `Build` button to compile.

You need to modify th lines in the `src/main.cpp` file, change to your actual pins.

```cpp
#define MDATA 5
#define MCLK 4
const int buttonPin1 = 22;
const int buttonPin2 = 23;
```

## Button
- left click = left click
- right click = right click
- move mouse = move touchpad
- scroll mode = toggle with button1
- fast scroll horizontal and vertical = move touchpad (I can't make it slow XD)
- slow scroll vertical = left and right click
- ctrl = button2 (for zoom in-out with scroll)
- forward = button2 + right click
- backward = button2 + left click
